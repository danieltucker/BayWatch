# BayWatch

A self-hosted Docker app that creates a visual bay map for your NAS or server — showing which drive is in which slot, with live SMART health, temperature, warranty tracking, ZFS pool integration, and more.

No more pulling drives to figure out which one is which.

## Features

- **Visual bay grid** — drag-and-drop drives into slots across one or more enclosures
- **SMART monitoring** — automated temperature, power-on hours, reallocated/pending sectors, and uncorrectable error collection
- **Drive health score** — drive-type-aware composite 0–100 score with ring gauge; click the ring for a per-factor breakdown modal with temperature history chart
- **Drive classification** — tag each drive as Consumer HDD, NAS HDD, Enterprise HDD, Consumer/Enterprise SSD, NVMe, or Optane; shapes the age curve and heat exposure scoring
- **Lifetime I/O** — cumulative bytes read and written shown on every drive card, sourced from SMART history
- **Per-drive metadata** — make, model, serial, capacity, firmware, form factor, RPM, drive type, rated TBW, ZFS pool assignment
- **ZFS pool integration** — pool topology panel with vdev tree, pool capacity widgets, and per-drive pool labels
- **Disconnected drive detection** — drives no longer found by the scanner are flagged in the bay grid and Drive Details panel; a toast and Telegram notification fire on disconnect
- **Drive history modal** — 90-day charts for temperature, used space, I/O activity, and reallocated sectors, accessible from any drive's details panel
- **Customizable widget bar** — drag-to-reorder: Total Drives, Health %, Avg Temp, Hottest Drive, Total Capacity, Oldest Drive, and more
- **Terminal console** — press `` ` `` for live log streaming with level filters and a full command interface
- **Warranty tracking** — expiry alerts and warnings configurable in advance
- **Telegram notifications** — SMART failures, overtemp, disconnect events, warranty warnings, scheduled status reports
- **CSV bulk import** — import existing drive inventories from a spreadsheet
- **REST API** — `/v1/` endpoints with API key auth for Grafana, Home Assistant, scripts, and integrations
- **Federation** — aggregate drive data from multiple remote BayWatch instances; remote instances show as a bay grid (matching the remote layout) with hover-to-preview and click-to-detail; toggle to flat list per instance
- Works on **TrueNAS Scale**, **Unraid**, or any Linux-based Docker host

## Installing on TrueNAS Scale

BayWatch ships as a single combined container (nginx + uvicorn under supervisord), so the entire app is one image with one exposed port.

### Option A — Custom App via iX Apps UI (recommended)

This is the preferred setup for auto-updates with Watchtower or management through the TrueNAS Apps UI.

1. In the TrueNAS web UI, go to **Apps → Discover Apps → Custom App**
2. Fill in the sections as follows:

**Image Configuration**
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | `danielgt/baywatch` |
| Tag | `latest` |
| Pull Policy | Always pull |

**Container Configuration → Ports**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Host Port | `8585` (or any port you prefer) |
| Container Port | `80` |
| Protocol | TCP |

**Container Configuration → Environment Variables**

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:////app/data/baywatch.db` |
| `SCAN_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | `60` |

> Temperature thresholds, log level, and Telegram credentials are configured inside the app under **Settings → Notifications**.

**Container Configuration → Storage**

Host path mounts:

| Host Path | Mount Path | Read Only |
|---|---|---|
| `/dev` | `/dev` | No |
| `/run/udev` | `/run/udev` | Yes |

Persistent volume:

| Type | Mount Path |
|---|---|
| ixVolume (or host path) | `/app/data` |

> This is where the SQLite database lives — your bay map, drive profiles, and settings are all stored here. Use an ixVolume or a bind-mount to a path on your pool (e.g. `/mnt/tank/baywatch-data`).

**Security Context**

Enable **Privileged Mode** — required for `smartctl` to access block devices.

3. Click **Install**

### Option B — docker-compose

Paste [`docker-compose.truenas.yml`](docker-compose.truenas.yml) into the **Compose File** field in Custom App, or run directly with `docker compose`:

```yaml
services:
  baywatch:
    image: danielgt/baywatch:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /dev:/dev
      - /run/udev:/run/udev:ro
      - baywatch_data:/app/data
    privileged: true
    ports:
      - "8585:80"
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: sqlite:////app/data/baywatch.db
      SCAN_INTERVAL_MINUTES: "60"

volumes:
  baywatch_data:
```

---

## Auto-updates with Watchtower

Watchtower will automatically update BayWatch whenever a new `latest` tag is pushed to Docker Hub.

**Watchtower iX App setup:**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | `containrrr/watchtower` |
| Tag | `latest` |
| Pull Policy | Always pull |

Under **Volumes**, mount the Docker socket:

| Host Path | Mount Path |
|---|---|
| `/var/run/docker.sock` | `/var/run/docker.sock` |

Watchtower polls Docker Hub every 24 hours by default and restarts containers when a new image is found.

> Your data is stored in the `/app/data` volume and is never touched during an update — only the container image is replaced.

---

## Accessing the App

Once running, open:

```
http://<host-ip>:8585
```

---

## First-time Setup

1. Go to **Settings** (top-right gear icon) and open the **Enclosures** tab
2. Add an enclosure (e.g. "TrueNAS Main", type: Server)
3. Add a bay array with the correct row × column layout for your chassis
4. Click **Scan** on the Dashboard to detect all connected drives
5. Drag drives from the sidebar into the correct bay slots

![Settings: Enclosures tab for managing enclosures and bay arrays](screenshots/settings-enclosures.png)

## Drive Health Score

Each drive displays a composite health score from 0–100, shown as a ring gauge in the drive details panel. Click the ring to open a per-factor breakdown with a recommendation and full temperature history chart.

### How it's calculated

The score starts at **100** for any drive with a `PASSED` SMART status. Drives with a `FAILED` SMART status are immediately scored **0**. Drives with an `UNKNOWN` SMART status show no score.

Deductions are applied across four factor categories:

**SMART errors**

| Factor | Condition | Deduction |
|---|---|---|
| **SMART status** | `FAILED` | Score = 0 immediately |
| **Reallocated sectors** | > 0 | −4 per sector, max −40 |
| **Pending sectors** | > 0 | −5 per sector, max −25 |
| **Uncorrectable errors** | > 0 | −10 per error, max −35 |

**Age (drive-type-aware)**

Age curves vary by drive class so that enterprise and NAS drives are not penalised as early as consumer models:

| Drive type | Warn threshold | Max threshold | Deductions |
|---|---|---|---|
| Consumer HDD / Consumer SSD / NVMe consumer | 30,000 h | 50,000 h | −5 / −10 / −20 |
| NAS HDD | 40,000 h | 60,000 h | −5 / −10 / −20 |
| Enterprise HDD / Enterprise SSD / NVMe enterprise | 55,000 h | 80,000 h | −5 / −10 / −20 |
| Intel Optane | 70,000 h | 100,000 h | −5 / −10 / −20 |

Drive type is set in Edit Drive → Drive Classification. If left on auto-detect it is inferred from RPM and model name.

**Cumulative heat exposure**

Rather than checking the current temperature at a single point in time, the heat factor analyses all available scan history to compute what percentage of readings exceeded the warn and danger thresholds:

| History depth | Condition | Deduction |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 3 readings | > 30% of readings above danger threshold | −20 |
| ≥ 3 readings | > 15% of readings above danger threshold | −10 |
| ≥ 3 readings | > 40% of readings above warn threshold | −8 |
| ≥ 3 readings | > 20% of readings above warn threshold | −4 |
| < 3 readings (spot check) | Current temp ≥ danger | −15 |
| < 3 readings (spot check) | Current temp ≥ warn | −8 |

**TBW endurance (SSD only)**

If a rated TBW is set for the drive (in Edit Drive → Rated TBW), and cumulative write history is available:

| Condition | Deduction |
|---|---|
| > 80% of rated TBW used | −25 |
| > 60% of rated TBW used | −15 |
| > 40% of rated TBW used | −8 |

### Score labels

| Score | Label |
|---|---|
| 90–100 | Excellent |
| 75–89 | Good |
| 60–74 | Fair |
| 40–59 | Poor |
| 0–39 | Critical |

## External API

BayWatch exposes a versioned REST API at `/v1/` for external integrations — dashboards, monitoring tools, Home Assistant, scripts, and federation between instances.

### Authentication

All `/v1/` endpoints except `/v1/health` require an API key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer dm_your_key_here
```

Generate keys under **Settings → API Keys**. The full plaintext key is shown **once** at creation — copy it immediately. After leaving the tab, use the **Show** button to reveal it again within the same browser session, or **Regenerate** to issue a new key (the old key is revoked immediately).

**Rate limit:** 120 requests per minute per key prefix. Exceeding this returns `429 Too Many Requests`.

![Settings: API Keys tab for generating and managing API keys](screenshots/settings-api-keys.png)

### Error Responses

All authenticated endpoints share the same error shapes:

| Status | When | Response body |
|---|---|---|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid API key | `{"detail": "Invalid or missing API key"}` |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit exceeded (120 req/min per key) | `{"detail": "Rate limit exceeded"}` |
| `404 Not Found` | Requested resource doesn't exist | `{"detail": "Drive not found"}` |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` | Invalid query parameter type or value | `{"detail": [{"loc": ["query", "days"], "msg": "Input should be less than or equal to 90", "type": "less_than_equal"}]}` |

## Federation

Federation lets you designate one BayWatch instance as a hub that pulls live data from one or more remote BayWatch instances ("targets") and displays them in the Dashboard under **Remote Instances**.

### How it works

The hub polls each target's `/v1/` API at a configurable interval (5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes), caches the snapshot in memory, and renders the remote drives in a read-only panel below the local bay grid.

### Setup

**On each target instance:**
1. Go to **Settings → API Keys** and generate a key. Copy it — it's shown once (or use **Show** to reveal it again in the same browser session).

**On the hub instance:**
1. Go to **Settings → Federation** and click **Add Target**
2. Enter a name, the target's URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.51:8585`), the API key from step 1, and a sync interval
3. Click **Add Target** — the hub will begin polling on the next scheduler tick

The **Remote Instances** panel appears in the Dashboard automatically once at least one target has synced successfully. Each remote instance defaults to a **bay grid view** — a colour-coded layout matching the remote enclosure structure where green = SMART PASSED, red = FAILED, grey = unknown. Hover any bay cell to preview the drive details in the right sidebar. Click to open the full DriveCard with temperature history (fetched live from the remote instance). Use the grid/list toggle button in each instance header to switch to a flat drive list; preference persists per-instance. Click **Sync Now** in Settings → Federation to trigger an immediate poll.

![Settings: Federation tab for managing remote BayWatch instances](screenshots/settings-federation.png)

### Notes

- Targets must be running BayWatch v1.0.0 or later.
- Federation target API keys are stored in plaintext in the local SQLite database — the same threat model as the Telegram bot token. This is appropriate for LAN-only deployments on a trusted host.
- If a sync fails, the last error is shown in the Federation tab. The hub continues serving the last successful snapshot until the next successful poll.
- Before exposing any BayWatch instance to the internet, restrict CORS origins and place the app behind a reverse proxy with TLS and authentication.

---

## Requirements

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Linux host (bare metal or VM) — required for `/dev` access and SMART data
- Privileged container mode (required for `smartctl`)
